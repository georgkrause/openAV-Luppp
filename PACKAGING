Thanks for looking into packaging Loopp:
OpenAV couldn't possibly package for every distro,
your work is apprecatied!

CMake is used as the build system, checkout the compile.sh
script in the 'build' directory: its pretty simple.

Notes for packaging:

=== Controllers directory
Install controllers directory (and contents) to
/usr/share/loopp/controllers

Result: dir:    /usr/share/loopp/controllers/
        files:  /usr/share/loopp/controllers/<filename>.ctlr


=== Questions

Thanks again! -Harry
